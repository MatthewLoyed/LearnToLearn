## Open Questions

1. **Resource Rating System:** Should users be able to rate individual resources, or just milestone completion?
2. **Progress Persistence:** How long should user progress be stored locally vs. requiring user accounts?
3. **Visual Component Complexity:** What level of interactivity is appropriate for the skill tree visualization?
4. **Performance vs. Features:** What's the acceptable trade-off between feature richness and loading performance?
5. **Content Moderation:** How should we handle user-generated content like resource ratings and reviews?
6. **Mobile Optimization:** Should we prioritize mobile-specific interactions for the visual learning components?
