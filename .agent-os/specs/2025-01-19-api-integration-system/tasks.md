## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED)

### **Issue 1: Content Relevance Problems**

- **Problem**: System returning irrelevant content (Mortal Kombat videos for juggling, cricket/baseball images for juggling)
- **Impact**: Severely degrades user experience and educational value
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

### **Issue 2: Google Custom Search Fundamentally Broken** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

- **Problem**: Google Custom Search API returns completely irrelevant images (cricket for juggling, baseball for juggling)
- **Impact**: Image search is unusable for educational content
- **Priority**: CRITICAL ‚Üí **RESOLVED** (Image search completely removed from system)
- **Resolution**: Detached image search functionality, focus shifted to milestone-based learning with videos and articles

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Remove Topic Detection Algorithm**

  - [x] Removed broken topic classification (was detecting "juggling" as "programming")
  - [x] File: `src/lib/services/youtube/youtube-service.ts`
  - [x] Impact: HIGH - Eliminates incorrect search strategies

- [ ] **Implement Content Relevance Validation**

  - [ ] Add post-search validation to verify content matches milestone context
  - [ ] File: `src/lib/utils/quality/quality-engine.ts`
  - [ ] Impact: HIGH - Prevents irrelevant content distribution

- [x] **Improve Google Custom Search Query Accuracy**

  - [x] Added ChatGPT-powered intelligent query generation
  - [x] Removed overly restrictive filters to see actual API results
  - [x] Enhanced prompts to include clarifying keywords for ambiguous skills
  - [x] File: `src/lib/services/images/image-service.ts`, `src/lib/services/openai/openai-service.ts`
  - [x] Impact: MEDIUM - Query generation improved but Google Custom Search still returns irrelevant results

- [x] **Remove Unnecessary Bing Fallback**
  - [x] Removed Bing Image Search fallback that was causing errors
  - [x] File: `src/lib/services/images/image-service.ts`
  - [x] Impact: MEDIUM - Eliminates unnecessary API errors

### **Issue 2: Content Distribution Gaps**

- **Problem**: Not all milestones get complete content (e.g., "1/2 real articles")
- **Impact**: Incomplete learning experience
- **Priority**: HIGH

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Fix Content Distribution Completeness**
  - [ ] Ensure all milestones get required content (1 video + 2 articles each)
  - [ ] File: `src/lib/services/search/search-service.ts`
  - [ ] Impact: HIGH - Complete learning experience
