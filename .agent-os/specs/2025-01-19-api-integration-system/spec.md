## User Stories

### Enhanced Content Discovery

**As a learner**, I want to receive high-quality, relevant learning resources that are specifically curated for my skill level and learning objectives, so that I can efficiently master new skills without wasting time on poor or irrelevant content.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. User generates a learning roadmap for any topic
2. System analyzes the topic and classifies learning intent
3. AI generates structured milestones with specific learning objectives
4. For each milestone, system searches for:
   - 2-3 high-quality YouTube videos (appropriate length, quality, relevance)
   - 1-2 authoritative articles or tutorials
   - Relevant educational diagrams and visual aids
5. Content is ranked and filtered based on quality metrics
6. User receives a comprehensive roadmap with vetted, high-quality resources
7. User can provide feedback to improve future recommendations

### Real-Time Content Integration

**As a learner**, I want the content curation to happen in real-time during roadmap generation, so that I receive the most current and relevant resources available.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. User starts roadmap generation process
2. System shows real-time progress (8-step process with live updates)
3. Step 4-5: Real YouTube and article search with live status updates
4. System displays "Searching YouTube for [specific topic]" and "Finding articles about [specific concept]"
5. Content is enhanced in real-time as APIs return results
6. Final roadmap includes fresh, current resources found during generation
7. System provides transparency about which resources are live vs. cached

### Quality Assurance System

**As a learner**, I want assurance that all recommended content meets high educational standards, so that I can trust the learning path and focus on learning rather than evaluating resource quality.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. System applies multiple quality filters to all content
2. YouTube videos are filtered by: view count, like ratio, channel authority, content length appropriateness
3. Articles are filtered by: domain authority, publication date, content depth, educational focus
4. Visual content is verified for educational value and accuracy
5. User sees quality indicators (verified badges, quality scores, source credibility)
6. System continuously learns from user interactions to improve quality detection
7. Poor-quality content is automatically filtered out or flagged
