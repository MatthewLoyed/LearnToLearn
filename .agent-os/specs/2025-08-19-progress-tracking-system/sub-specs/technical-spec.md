# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-19-progress-tracking-system/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Progress State Management

- **ProgressContext**: React Context for global progress state management
  - Store learning path progress, milestone completion status, and achievement data
  - Provide methods for updating progress, marking milestones complete, and unlocking achievements
  - Handle state persistence and synchronization with local storage
  - Support multiple learning paths with unique identifiers

### Data Persistence

- **useLocalStorage Hook**: Custom hook for local storage management
  - Secure storage of progress data with encryption for sensitive information
  - Automatic data migration and versioning for schema updates
  - Fallback handling for storage quota exceeded scenarios
  - Data compression for large progress datasets

### Progress Tracking Logic

- **useProgress Hook**: Custom hook for progress calculations and analytics
  - Real-time progress percentage calculations based on completed milestones
  - Learning velocity tracking (milestones completed per time period)
  - Time-based analytics (time spent on different learning activities)
  - Achievement eligibility checking and unlock logic

### Visual Components

- **ProgressTracker Component**: Main progress visualization component
  - Responsive progress bars with smooth animations
  - Milestone completion indicators with checkmarks and timestamps
  - Progress percentage display with color-coded status indicators
  - Integration with existing skill tree and roadmap components

### Achievement System

- **AchievementBadge Component**: Gamification and reward system
  - Configurable achievement criteria (milestone count, completion percentage, time-based)
  - Visual badge designs with unlock animations and celebration effects
  - Achievement history tracking and display
  - Integration with progress context for automatic unlocking

### Utility Functions

- **Progress Utilities**: Helper functions for data management and calculations
  - Progress calculation algorithms (percentage, velocity, trends)
  - Data validation and sanitization for progress records
  - Export functionality for learning analytics
  - Performance optimization for large datasets

### API Integration

- **Progress API Routes**: Backend endpoints for future cloud synchronization
  - POST /api/track-progress - Record progress updates
  - GET /api/progress/:userId - Retrieve user progress data
  - PUT /api/progress/:userId - Update progress records
  - DELETE /api/progress/:userId - Clear progress data (with confirmation)

### Performance Requirements

- **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates must reflect immediately in UI
- **Smooth Animations**: All progress animations should be 60fps with proper easing
- **Memory Efficiency**: Handle large progress datasets without performance degradation
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet connection using local storage

### Accessibility Requirements

- **Screen Reader Support**: All progress elements must be properly labeled and announced
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all progress controls
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color schemes for progress indicators
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling for dynamic content updates

### Error Handling

- **Storage Errors**: Graceful degradation when local storage is unavailable
- **Data Corruption**: Automatic recovery and data validation
- **Network Failures**: Offline-first approach with sync when connection restored
- **Invalid Data**: Input validation and sanitization for all progress updates

## External Dependencies

### Required Dependencies

- **Framer Motion**: For smooth progress animations and achievement celebrations
  - Justification: Provides high-performance animations and gesture support for interactive progress elements
- **date-fns**: For date manipulation and time-based progress calculations
  - Justification: Lightweight date utility library for tracking learning timelines and analytics
- **zustand**: For additional state management if Context API becomes insufficient
  - Justification: Provides more advanced state management features for complex progress tracking scenarios

### Optional Dependencies

- **recharts**: For progress analytics and learning trend visualization
  - Justification: Professional charting library for displaying learning analytics and progress trends
- **react-hot-toast**: For achievement unlock notifications
  - Justification: Lightweight toast notification system for achievement celebrations and progress updates
