# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Progress Tracking System
> Created: 2025-08-19

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive progress tracking system that enables users to track their learning journey through milestones, achievements, and persistent data storage. This system will enhance user engagement by providing visual feedback on learning progress and gamification elements to motivate continued skill development.

## User Stories

### Progress Visualization

As a learner, I want to see my progress through learning milestones and achievements, so that I can stay motivated and understand how far I've come in my skill development journey.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. User starts a learning path and sees initial progress indicators
2. As they complete milestones (videos watched, articles read, exercises completed), progress updates in real-time
3. Visual progress bars, completion percentages, and achievement badges provide immediate feedback
4. Progress persists across browser sessions using local storage
5. Users can view their learning history and track improvement over time

### Achievement Recognition

As a learner, I want to receive recognition for completing milestones and achieving learning goals, so that I feel accomplished and motivated to continue learning.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. System tracks completion of various learning activities (videos, articles, exercises)
2. Achievement badges unlock based on completion criteria (first milestone, 50% completion, etc.)
3. Visual celebrations appear when achievements are unlocked
4. Achievement history is maintained and displayed in a dedicated section
5. Users can share achievements or view their learning statistics

### Learning Analytics

As a learner, I want to understand my learning patterns and effectiveness, so that I can optimize my study habits and focus on areas that need improvement.

**Detailed Workflow:**

1. System tracks time spent on different learning activities
2. Progress analytics show completion rates, time to completion, and learning velocity
3. Visual charts and graphs display learning trends over time
4. Recommendations suggest optimal study patterns based on user behavior
5. Users can export their learning data for personal analysis

## Spec Scope

1. **ProgressContext Implementation** - Global state management for learning progress across the application
2. **useLocalStorage Hook** - Persistent data storage for user progress and preferences
3. **useProgress Hook** - Custom hook for progress tracking logic and calculations
4. **ProgressTracker Component** - Visual progress tracking with milestone completion indicators
5. **Achievement Badge System** - Gamification elements with unlockable achievements and celebrations
6. **Progress Utilities** - Helper functions for progress calculations, analytics, and data management
7. **API Integration** - Backend routes for progress synchronization and analytics (future Supabase integration)

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and cloud-based progress synchronization (Phase 2)
- Social features like sharing achievements or competing with others (Phase 2)
- Advanced analytics dashboard with detailed reporting (Phase 2)
- Machine learning-based progress predictions (Phase 3)
- Integration with external learning management systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. A fully functional progress tracking system that persists user progress locally and provides real-time visual feedback on learning milestones and achievements
2. Achievement badge system with unlockable rewards and celebration animations that enhance user motivation and engagement
3. Progress analytics and learning insights that help users understand their learning patterns and optimize their study habits
