# Spec Summary (Lite)

Enhance the existing Skill Forge platform with an AI-powered skill deconstruction engine that dynamically breaks down any skill (physical or abstract) into essential 20/80 components with actionable milestones and "Do This Now" prompts. The engine will extend the current roadmap generation system to provide structured, interactive learning paths that force active engagement rather than passive consumption. Users can enter queries like "how to improve at javascript" and receive progressive learning levels with embedded videos followed by mandatory practice activities tracked through localStorage session management. This builds on the existing SkillTree component, OpenAI service, and content integration system. Database persistence will be added later when cross-device sync is needed.
