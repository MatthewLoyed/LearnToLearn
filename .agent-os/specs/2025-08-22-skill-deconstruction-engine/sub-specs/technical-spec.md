# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-22-skill-deconstruction-engine/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Core Engine Architecture

- **OpenAI Integration**: Enhanced OpenAI service to generate skill deconstruction with structured output format
- **Skill Type Detection**: Algorithm to classify skills as physical vs abstract based on user query analysis
- **Progressive Level Generation**: AI prompt engineering to create 3-5 progressive learning levels
- **Milestone Creation**: Structured milestone generation with measurable outcomes and success criteria
- **Practice Prompt Generation**: "Do This Now" prompt creation with reps/sets structure for both skill types

### Data Structure Requirements

- **Skill Tree Schema**: JSON structure for storing deconstructed skills with levels, milestones, and practice prompts
- **Progress Tracking**: localStorage-based session management for tracking milestone completion and practice activity status
- **Content Integration**: Seamless integration with existing video and article content from current roadmap system (visual content removed)
- **Practice Validation**: System to track completion of practice activities and provide feedback

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Professional Dashboard**: Clean, modern skill tree visualization with milestone-specific icons
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual progress tracking with completion status and estimated completion times
- **Interactive Milestones**: Clickable milestones that expand to show video content and practice activities
- **Practice Interface**: Dedicated interface for completing "Do This Now" activities with completion tracking
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components

### Integration Requirements

- **API Route Enhancement**: Modify existing `/api/generate-roadmap` to use new deconstruction engine
- **Content Distribution**: Intelligent distribution of existing video and article content across new milestone structure (visual content removed)
- **Session Management**: localStorage-based progress tracking for milestone completion during testing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when AI deconstruction fails or content is unavailable

### Performance Criteria

- **Response Time**: Skill deconstruction should complete within 10-15 seconds
- **Content Loading**: Milestone content should load within 3 seconds
- **Progress Updates**: Practice completion should update immediately with visual feedback
- **Scalability**: System should handle concurrent skill deconstruction requests efficiently

## External Dependencies

- **OpenAI API (Enhanced)**: Existing OpenAI integration will be enhanced with new prompt engineering for skill deconstruction
- **Lucide React Icons**: For milestone-specific icons (gears for programming, balls for juggling, etc.)
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations in progress dashboard and milestone interactions
- **React Hook Form**: For practice activity completion tracking and validation

**Justification for Dependencies:**

- **Lucide React Icons**: Provides consistent, scalable icons for different skill types and milestones
- **Framer Motion**: Essential for smooth, professional animations that enhance user experience without being gamified
- **React Hook Form**: Provides robust form handling for practice activity completion with validation and error handling
